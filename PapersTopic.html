<H3>12. Variance-Reduced Stochastic Gradient Methods for Compositional Optimization Problems.</H3>
Compositional Optimization are a class of optimization problems that appear very often in many machine learning applications,
such as portfolio management, reinforcement learning and stochastic neighbor embedding. The goal is to find the minimizer of the
composition of expectations of two stochastic functions, and therefore is more challenging to optimize than vanilla stochastic
optimization problem. Under this project, some investigations are made on variance-reduced stochastic gradient methods
that solve compositional optimization problems. In [1] a team of W. Hu's collaborators
(W. Hu participated in the writing of a very initial draft
regarding this problem and thus the list of authors include W. Hu himself)
proposed a compositional version of StochAstic Recursive grAdient algoritHm (SARAH-Compositional)
and proved that it achieved the best known Incremental First-order Oracle (IFO) complexity upper bound (at the time of publication).
Unfortunately the complete <A HREF="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.13515">arXiv</A> version of this work contains a gap in the proof
found by W. Hu and he feels that he cannot fill it in.
In a recent work [2] done in 2020, H. Yuan brought W. Hu's attention to the
STOchastic Recursive Momentum method, and based on this, the two authors propose the STORM-Compositional optimization
that introduces the momentum term in the compositional gradient updates. STORM-Compositional is thus operating the stochastic recursive
variance-reduced compositional gradients in an exponential-moving average way. STORM-Compositional avoids
the missing gap in SARAH-Compositional (see the complete <A HREF="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.13515">arXiv</A> version)
mentioned before. This leads to the same IFO complexity
that matches SARAH-Compositional. At the same time, STORM-Compositional is a single loop algorithm that avoids typical
alternative tuning between large and small batch sizes, as well as recording of checkpoint gradients,
that persist in variance-reduced stochastic gradient methods.
This allows considerably simpler parameter tuning in numerical experiments, which demonstrates the
superiority of STORM-Compositional over other stochastic compositional optimization algorithms.

<b>Statement of Contribution of the work</b> [2]:
H. Yuan brought W. Hu's attention to this problem and participated in one small discussion when W. Hu raised the question
on the mini-batch sampling with replacement and another discussion about a question raised by W. Hu
regarding the missing bound in <A HREF="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.13515">this work</A>,
the latter leading W. Hu to look at a relevant paper.

<H3>11. Markov Decision Processes and Reinforcement Learning applied to Microgrid and Manufacturing Systems.</H3>

Several real-world applications of Markov Decision Process (MDP) and Reinforcement Learning are considered under this project.
In [1], we propose a joint dynamic decision-making model for the optimal control for both manufacturing system and
onsite generation system via MDP and a neural network integrated reinforcement learning algorithm.
In [2] a real-time decision-making model is proposed for the
electric vehicle (EV) aggregator to dynamically control the energy flow between the grid and
each individual EV in the aggregated group.
<P>
In a recent work [3] finished in 2020, we propose a joint dynamic control model of microgrids and manufacturing systems using
Markov Decision Process (MDP) to identify an optimal control strategy for both microgrid components and
manufacturing system so that the energy cost for production can be minimized without sacrificing production throughput.
The proposed MDP model has a high dimensional state/action space and is complicated in that the state and action spaces
have both discrete and continuous parts and are intertwined through constraints. To resolve these challenges, a
novel reinforcement learning algorithm that leverages both on-policy temporal difference control (TD-control) and
deterministic policy gradient (DPG) algorithms is proposed. In this algorithm, the values of discrete decision actions
are learned through neural network integrated temporal difference iteration, while the parameterized values of continuous
actions are learned from deterministic policy gradients. The constraints are then addressed via proximal projection
operators at the policy gradient updates. Experiments for a manufacturing system with an onsite microgrid with renewable
sources have been implemented to identify optimal control actions for both manufacturing system and microgrid
components towards cost optimality. The experimental results show the effectiveness of combining TD control
and policy gradient methodologies in addressing the "curse of dimensionality" in dynamic decision-making
with high dimensional and complicated state and action spaces. We refer to <A HREF="slides_RL-Manufacturing.pdf">

<H3>10. Diffusion limit of stochastic approximation algorithms (e.g. stochastic gradient descent).</H3>
<P>
Many large-scale learning problems in modern statistics and machine learning can
be reduced to solving stochastic optimization problems, i.e., the search for (local) minimum
points of the expectation of an objective random function (loss function). These optimization
problems are usually solved by certain stochastic approximation algorithms,
which are recursive update rules with random inputs in each iteration. Under this project, we have been considering
various types of such stochastic approximation algorithms, including the stochastic
gradient descent, the stochastic composite gradient descent and the stochastic heavy-ball method.
By introducing approximating diffusion processes to the discrete recursive
schemes, we have analyzed the convergence of the diffusion limits to these algorithms via delicate techniques
in stochastic analysis and asymptotic methods. You may also look at

<H3>9. Covariance matrix estimation under High-Dimensional-Low-Sample-Size (HDLSS) setting and regularized linear discriminant analysis.</H3>
<P>
Statistical estimation and inference under High-Dimensional-Low-Sample-Size (HDLSS) setting is one of the most challenging problems in the big data era. Under this research project, we propose various regularization methods using small size sample in the estimation of covariance matrices under high dimensional setting. These methods are then exploited to develop novel techniques in improving the inferential performance of the classical Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and concrete experiments are implemented on Electronic Health Records (EHR) dataset.

<H3>8. Multiscale Stochastic PDEs.</H3>
<P>
Stochastic partial differential equations of reaction-diffusion type have been introduced to model the spacial-temporal evolution of concentrations of various components in a chemical reaction. The stochastic noises are responsible for the random changes in space-time of the rates of reaction. As a rule, the rates of chemical reactions in the system and the diffusion coefficients have different orders. Some of them are much smaller than others and this leads to the consideration of stochastic reaction-diffusion equations with a separation of slow and fast scales, i.e. multiscale stochastic reaction-diffusion equations. Under this project, we consider for the first time the problem of large deviations for multiscale stochastic reaction-diffusion equations in multiple dimensions with multiplicative noise.

<H3>7. Two-dimensional stochastic fluid mechanics and turbulence models.</H3>
The famous canonical picture of 2-d turbulence due to Kraichnan
[Kraichnan, R.H., Inertial ranges in two dimensional turbulence, <i>Physics of Fluids</i>, <b>10</b>(7), pp. 1417-1423, 1967]
conjectures the downward energy and enstrophy cascades which spread the excitations to low Fourier modes through the nonlinearity.
In a series of groundbreaking works starting from
[Hairer, M., Mattingly, J. C., Ergodicity of the 2-d Navier-Stokes equations with degenerate stochastic forcing. <i>Annals of Mathematics</i> (2), <b>164</b>(3):993-1032, 2006],
unique ergodicity has been developed under the physically important case of a spatially degenerate (that is frequency localized) stochastic forcing.
In this project, we study problems of 2-d turbulence related to Kraichnan's conjectures from various geometric and dynamical perspectives.
We show (see our work [1] below) that if we consider the 2-d Navier-Stokes equations on the torus T^2 and we modify the viscous term to
damp all but finitely many modes, then all solutions converge in the long-time limit to a stationary solution to the 2-d Euler equation living on those finitely many modes.
Then one can classify those stationary solutions precisely. For example, if one removes damping from exactly two modes which are of
different frequency and in different directions (like sin(2x) and cos(y) for example), then solutions must choose one of the two modes and land only on one of them.
This "choice" happens through a non-linear process and it is unclear whether there are even statistics of which one is most likely chosen
(though, one expects that the stationary solution with the lowest frequency is generically chosen in the long-time limit).
To understand this non-linear process more thoroughly, we propose geometric approaches in our works [2] and [3] below, where we study finite-dimensional model problems
for the 2-d Navier-Stokes and Euler equations respecting their Hamiltonian and Lie-Poisson structures. We reveal mechanisms that lead to the interactions
of the nonlinearity, the stochastic noise and the partial dissipation. These interactions lead to novel long-time limit of the solutions. See

<H3>6. Human mobility patterns via Hawkes processes.</H3>
<P>
The Hawkes process is a simple point process that has long memory, clustering effect, self-exciting property and is in general non-Markovian. The future evolution of a self-exciting point process is influenced by the timing of the past events. By making use of a multivariate Hawkes process (MHP) on a network, we characterize the human mobility patterns and discover the synchronization effect of trip purposes from real-world data.

<H3>4. Small mass limit of the Langevin equation (Smoluchowski-Kramers approximation).</H3>
<P>
The Langevin equation is one of the most classical models in stochastic calculus for the random motion of a particle suspended in a fluid. As a second-order stochastic differential equation, it describes the dynamics of a particle subject to a deterministic drift, a friction proportional to its velocity, as well as random fluctuations. The small-mass limit of this equation, sometimes also called the Smoluchowski-Kramers approximation, has been the main justification of using a first order stochastic differential equation to replace the original second-order equation. I have been considering

<H3>3. Reaction-diffusion equations and wave front propagation in random media.</H3>
<P>
Molecular motors, which are biological molecular machines that are the essential agents of movement in living organisms, can be modeled as diffusion particles traveling in a designated track. To model the environment in which the fluctuations due to thermal noise are significant, I have been considering the traveling of these motors in a narrow random channel. Under the asymptotic when the channel width is thin, I derive the limiting process as a diffusion process on a graph (see the work [1] below).
Furthermore, I introduce in [2] a reaction-diffusion equation in random media, which models the change in space and time of the concentration of these motors. By making use of large deviations theory for diffusion processes in random media, I derive the wave front propagation formula for the corresponding reaction-diffusion system. For further information see
<A HREF="slides_On_diffusion_and_wave_front_propagation_in_narrow_random_channels.pdf">this slides</A>.
<P>
In a recent work [3] done in the year 2019, we consider the asymptotic wave speed for FKPP type
reaction-diffusion equations on a class of infinite random metric trees.
We show that a travelling wavefront emerges and we quantify it via a variational formula
involving the random branching degrees and the random branch lengths of the tree. Here
our key idea is to project the Brownian motion on the tree onto a one-dimensional
axis along the direction of the wave propagation. The projected process is
a multi-skewed Brownian motion, with skewness and interface sets that encode the metric structure of the tree.
Combined with analytic arguments based on the Feynman-Kac formula, this idea
connects our analysis of the wavefront propagation to the large deviations principle (LDP)
of the multi-skewed Brownian motion with random skewness and random interface set. For more information you can take a look at

The close relation between the theory of second-order differential equations and Markov processes with continuous trajectories benefits each other.

<H3>1. Random perturbations of dynamical systems.</H3>
<P>
Dynamical systems with small random inputs are ubiquitous phenomena that appear in many scientific and engineering discipline. In the understanding of the time-evolution of a complex system, one chooses a relatively few number of major factors that govern the evolution of the system while neglecting other factors that are relatively insignificant. Due to the undetectable nature of these other factors being neglected, in a mathematical model they usually present themselves as random inputs. The random inputs can be included in some parameters that characterize the system, such as diffusion coefficients, rates of chemical reactions, time scales, etc. . Neglecting these random inputs is only effective in the case of finite time evolution. In fact, on long time scales, the factors which were considered as negligible, can become important and even critical for determining the system's behavior. By making use of large deviations theory and averaging principle, I have analyzed various model problems such as

(a.k.a. nearly-elastic billiard system), a generalization of the Landau-Lifschitz dynamics characterizing the magnetization dynamics in ferromagnetics, as well as dynamical systems with reflecting boundary conditions. In a recent work [5] done in the year 2018, I considered the long-time behavior of random perturbations of a degenerate system as an extension of the classical Freidlin-Wentzell theory. See <A HREF="slides_perturbation-degenerate.pdf">this slides</A> for more detailed elaboration.
